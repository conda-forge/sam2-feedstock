# SAM2 was always part of "facebookresearch" never really released as software
# for the public.
# The way that upstream setup their setup.py file makes SAM-2 the name of the
# package seen by pip when one does pip list
# The sam2 package slipped through the conda-forge review process and was first
# generated by using an unofficial source https://github.com/conda-forge/sam2-feedstock/issues/4
# The sam2 package has since been morphed into pointing to the sam-2
# feedstock https://github.com/conda-forge/sam-2-feedstock
# which aims to stay closer to the official source where possible.
